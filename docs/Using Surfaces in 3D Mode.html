<body><h1>Using Surfaces in 3D Mode</h1>Surface Fix still allows
you to create and manage surfaces normally, so most of the surface functions should still work as they normally
would. You just need to be aware that when you're in 3D mode, calling
surface_set_target() or surface_reset_target() will reset the
projection to the default 3D one. So, just call d3d_set_projection(),
d3d_set_projection_ext(), or d3d_set_projection_ortho() after calling
surface_set_target() or surface_reset_target() and you'll be fine. Note
that you only need to change the projection after calling surface_reset_target() if
you're in a Draw event.<h3>Notes</h3>Just be sure to take note of a couple of things so you don't run into problems later:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Be
sure to set the aspect ratio correctly when you change the projection
after calling surface_set_target(). In case you don't know how to do
that, divide the surface's width by its height.<br></li><li>If
you want to use a surface as a texture for a 3D object, its width and height need to be
powers of two (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.). Otherwise, you
might see junk at the edges of the texture.</li></ul><h3>Example</h3>Here's an example that demonstrates the proper use of a surface in 3D mode:<br><br><code>// In this example, a 512x512 surface is being used.<br>// Its index is stored to the variable "surface".<br><br>// Set the render target to the surface and then set the projection<br>surface_set_target(surface);<br>d3d_set_projection_ext(0, -128, 16, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 1, 45, 1, 1, 10000);<br><br>// Clear the surface<br>draw_clear(c_black);<br><br>// Draw a blue cube<br>draw_set_color(c_blue);<br>d3d_draw_block(0, 0, 32, 32, 32, 0, -1, 0, 0);<br><br>// Reset the render target<br>surface_reset_target();<br></code></body></html>
