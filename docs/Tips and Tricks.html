a surface is created, it is not cleared. So, after you
create a surface, be sure to switch&nbsp;to the surface and then
clear it with draw_clear() or draw_clear_alpha(). Otherwise, it will be filled with garbage.</li><li>Surfaces only need to be powers of two in size when you use them as a texture. Otherwise, it doesn't matter.</li><li>If
you're trying to create a post-rendering effect, try to avoid redrawing
the screen as much as possible. It slows the game down. In some cases,
surface_copy() can be your friend here.</li><li>By using surfaces in
the Draw event, you can create interesting chains of rendering effects.
You do this by making surface start and end objects with different
depths. Each surface end object needs to have a lower depth than its corresponding surface start
object. In the Draw event, each surface start object should set the
drawing target to a surface, and then each surface end object should reset the target and draw that surface.
Then, every object that has a depth that's between the depths of the
surface start and end objects will get drawn to the surface. This
allows you to easily create some interesting effects.</li><li>Calling
the display changing functions will destroy all of your surfaces. This
is hard (if not impossible) to fix, so you can save your surfaces by using <a href="surface_write.html">surface_write()</a> and <a href="surface_read.html">surface_read()</a>.</li><li>Especially
when you use post-rendering effects, you need to check each step if your
surfaces exist and re-create them if they don't. This is because
certain system events (such as the screensaver popping up) can cause GM to lose its surfaces, so if you
don't perform checks you'll end up with errors when they are lost.</li></ul></body></html>
