<h1>surface_write(id, format)</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
Returns the contents of a surface as a string. You can choose to either
return raw binary data, where the surface's data is returned directly
(it's usually smaller and faster), or you can have it encode it into
a text format first (allowing you to write the surface to a text file,
but it's usually slower and larger).<br>
<br>
This function, along with&nbsp;<a href="surface_read.html">surface_read()</a>, is useful for keeping the contents of surfaces across calls to the
display functions (which destroy all of your surfaces). It also allows you to
save surfaces along with your saved games (if you use a custom format for your save data).<br>
<br>
Note that especially with larger surfaces, the string returned by this
function uses a lot of RAM. The surface is not compressed first. Be
sure to free the data returned by this once you don't need it anymore
(by setting
the variable you stored it to to a blank string, for example). Also, GM
rounds up surfaces so that they have widths and heights that are powers
of two. For example, this makes a 1025x1025 surface take up the same
amount of memory as a 2048x2048 surface (which&nbsp;takes up
approximately 16 MB of RAM in raw binary format). Be careful.<br>
<br>
You really should only use the text encoding option if you want to
save the surface to a text file. Otherwise, it wastes RAM and is
slower.<br>
<br>
Also note that this function is not very fast due to the way Direct3D
works. It is&nbsp;much faster than calling surface_getpixel() for
every pixel of the surface, though.<br>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
This function requires that you pass in 2 arguments:<br>
<ol>
<li>id - <span style="font-style: italic;">Real. </span>The
ID of the surface to get the contents of. The surface must exist.</li>
<li>format - <span style="font-style: italic;">Real.
</span>The format to encode the data in. Surface Fix provides
two constants that you can use for this: <span style="font-family: monospace;">df_binary</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">df_text</span>. Use the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">df_binary</span> constant to have this function return the raw binary data of
the surface, and use <span style="font-family: monospace;">df_text</span> to have this function return it in text
format.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">String. </span>This function returns a
string containing the contents of the surface in the chosen format.
If the function fails, an empty string is returned.<br>
<br>
The format of this string is as follows:<br>
<br>
<code>For the df_binary data format:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Byte 0</span> = 0xAA (ID used to
identify that the data is in binary format)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bytes 1-4</span> = Little-endian DWORD
value containing the width of the surface.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bytes 5-8</span> = Little-endian DWORD
value containing the height of the surface.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bytes 9-12</span> = Little-endian
DWORD value containing the size of a row in bytes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bytes 13 and on</span> = The color data. Each
pixel takes four bytes, giving each color component one byte. The
components of each color are in the following order: Blue, Green, Red,
Alpha. Note that since GM rounds up surface dimensions to powers of two, there may be padding in the color data.</code><br>
<code>For the df_text data format:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Character 1</span> = "/" (used to identify that
the data is in text format)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Characters 2 and on</span> = The binary data
(see above), encoded in an Ascii85-like format. If for some reason you need the exact
details of this format, PM me. I'm not going to explain it here.</code>
<h3>Example</h3><code>// This example demonstrates how to write a surface to a text file.<br>// The variable "surface" contains a surface that was created earlier.<br><br>// Open the text file for writing<br>file = file_text_open_write("surface.txt");<br><br>// Write the surface to the file<br>file_text_write_string(file, surface_write(surface, df_text));<br><br>// Close the file<br>file_text_close(file);</code>
